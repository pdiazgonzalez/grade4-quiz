        <h2>Adapted from Mom for City Council (Raz-Kids)</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Written By: Jessica Malardy</strong></p>
           
       <img src="https://github.com/pdiazgonzalez/grade4-quiz/blob/main/Mom_City_Council.png?raw=true" alt="Mom for City Council" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 33%;">

        <p><strong>1.</strong> It all began one afternoon at the Springfield Firehouse, where my mom works. “How can we do our jobs when the roads are so bad?” Sergeant Goodman grumbled.
</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> “You try talking to the city council,” Chief McConnell replied. “They say there’s no money in the budget for fixing the roads.”
</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> “Then the budget needs to change!” my mom declared. “I’m tired of our concerns being ignored or put off until later. Folks in this town rely on the fire department for help. We need a bridge over the river to help with traffic, and we need to fix the roads.”
</p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> That’s when I looked up from my homework and decided to jump in. “Mom,” I said, “you always tell me that instead of complaining about things, I should think about how to change them. How can you change these things?”
</p>

        <p><strong>5.</strong> My mom shook her head and sighed, “My job is to put out fires, Jasmine, not fix the roads.” I looked down and read quietly to myself from my social studies textbook:</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> <em>At the local level, communities are governed by city councils. City councils 
           make laws, plan major projects, and work to improve their communities. 
          City council members are elected by  local citizens to represent them and their needs.</em>
</p>
        <p><strong>7.</strong> Suddenly, I had an idea. “What if you were on the city council, Mom?” I exclaimed.</p>
        <p><strong>8.</strong> My mom laughed, but Chief McConnell rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “You know, she’s right. We could use a voice like yours in there, Kyla,” he said. “Passing laws, promoting safety, prioritizing the people’s needs.”</p>
        <p><strong>9.</strong> My mom looked thoughtful. “I’ve never really thought about it,” she admitted. “Think about it now,” Chief McConnell said, arching an eyebrow.</p>
  	<p><strong>10.</strong> A few weeks later, my mom and I took a trip down to Springfield’s city hall. We asked the election official what Mom needed to do to run for city council.</p>
	<p><strong>11.</strong> First, the official asked us where we lived. “You see, Springfield is made up of ten districts,” she explained. “Each district is represented by one city council member.” She pointed to a map: our district, Ward 6, was in the western part of the city, near the river. “In order to run for your local seat, first you need to get your name on the official ballot.” </p>
	<p><strong>12.</strong> To do that, my mom and I had to gather one hundred signatures from people who lived in Ward 6 before the end of the month! Luckily, my mom’s firehouse is in our district, so she had plenty of local support. We talked to librarians, teachers, and police officers as well as doctors and nurses at the community hospital. They all signed, and so did my mom’s fire company and our friends, family, and neighbors. In two weeks, we had over a hundred signatures, so we took them back to city hall. The next day, the newspaper ran a small article, “Local Firefighter Kyla Walker Running for Ward 6 Seat.” The race was on!</p>
	<p><strong>13.</strong> “Now what?” I asked my mom. “Now we knock on doors,” she said. ”It’s called <b><u>canvassing</b></u>, and it’s the best way to meet voters and learn what’s important to them. Hopefully, they’ll get to know me, too, and will decide to vote for me,” Mom explained.</p>
	<p><strong>14.</strong> Some people were helpful and some people just shut their doors on us. Sometimes people were surprised to find a ten-year-old on their doorstep. I tried to use that to my advantage. “I used to think politics was just for grown-ups,” I explained. “Now that I’m getting to know my community, I can see that politics touches everybody’s life. Everyone cares about something that a city council member can help with. That’s why it matters to elect someone who cares, too—like my mom, Kyla Walker.”</p>
	<p><strong>15.</strong> <b><u>Canvassing</b></u> worked! Many folks grew excited that my mom was running. They liked her goals: repairing our roads, creating new jobs, and funding our schools. Some supporters were so enthusiastic that they decided to volunteer with our campaign, and suddenly we had a whole team to help us. They went <b><u>canvassing</b></u>, too, working to convince our community that my mom would be the best representative.</p>
	<p><strong>16.</strong> At last, after three months, election night arrived. My mom told me, “Remember, Jasmine, no matter what happens, we’ve already won. We tried our hardest, and we’ve brought our community together. That’s no small thing.” I nodded, but my stomach felt like it was full of butterflies. I knew my mom was right, but I still really wanted her to win.</p>
	<p><strong>17.</strong> Finally, the news anchor cleared her throat, and the room went silent. “It’s been a tight city council race in Ward 6 between current representative Frank LaValle and challenger Kyla Walker,” the anchor said. “The final ballots are in, and the winner is . . .”The butterflies in my stomach went wild. “Kyla Walker!”</p>
